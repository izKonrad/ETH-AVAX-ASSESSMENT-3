### Getting Started
To run and interact with this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Here are the steps to get started:

### Executing program
1. Go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
2. Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.
3. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g.,MyToken.sol/ERC20Token.sol).
4. Copy and paste the provided Solidity code in the link https://github.com/izKonrad/ETH-AVAX-ASSESSMENT-3 and paste into the newly created file.
5. Compile the code by clicking on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Ensure that the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.26" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.
6. Deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
7. Interact with the contract.
